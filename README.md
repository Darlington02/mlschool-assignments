# Building Machine Learning Systems

"Building Machine Learning Systems" is designed to teach you how to train, evaluate, deploy, and monitor machine learning models in production. 

In this repository, you'll find the code to build a fully-fledged, end-to-end machine learning system that you can use as a starting point for your own projects.

This repository is a personal rewrite of the [Machine Learning School](https://www.ml.school) program for learning purposes.
